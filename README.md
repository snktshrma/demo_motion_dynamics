Dynamic model for space station motion

This repo contains motion dynamics of the space station, specifically attitude and orbital dynamics. This will be a part of physics model for the Space Station.

For reference, these are the external forces and torque considered while designing the motion dynamics of the space station:
Torque considered:
- Gravity Gradient
- Magnetic Torque
- Aerodynamic Torque
- Solar Radiation Pressure Torque
- Added gaussian noise

Force considered:
- Atmospheric Drag
- Solar radiation pressure
- Micro-Gravity
- Thrusts*
- Added gaussian noise
